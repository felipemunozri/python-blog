# Python Blog Project

This is my version of a web application Blog project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

The application is writen entirely on Python using Flask as framework and a sqlite as its database.

It features:

- Blog content management.
- Visitors can create accounts and comment on posts.
- Integration with Gravatar.
- Users can reset their password via secure token.
